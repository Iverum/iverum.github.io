            <a href="https://github.com/Iverum/DogsInTheForum">Dogs in the Forum</a>
            is a web app for play-by-post roleplaying using the
            <a href="http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/DogsInTheVineyard">Dogs in the Vineyard</a>
            system by
            <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/">D. Vincent Baker</a>. It is
            built using Javascript, specifically Node.js and React, to be
            almost entirely client side. The "backend" is provided by
            Firebase, using their key-value store database to track user data
            and interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built this partially to satisfy a desire to return to playing
            more table-top roleplaying games, but the distance between members
            of my play group and finding time when we could all play proved to
            be too much of a hassle. The idea was that this would provide an
            area where we could play at our own pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The architecture choices I made here were mostly about being able
            to rapidly iterate and deploy those changes to users. Javascript
            allows quick changes to be made available to users with a browser
            refresh and the entire app can be statically served from anywhere.
            Firebase provides me with database and authentication functions
            without needing to spend time building an entire backend for a
            low-value personal project.
