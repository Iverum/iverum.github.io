{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1><a href=\"https://github.com/Iverum/DogsInTheForum\">Dogs in the Forum</a></h1>\n<p>Dogs in the Forum is a web app for play-by-post roleplaying using the <a href=\"http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/DogsInTheVineyard\">Dogs in the Vineyard</a> system by <a href=\"http://www.lumpley.com/\">D. Vincent Baker</a>. It is built using Javascript, specifically Node.js and React, to be almost entirely client side. The \"backend\" is provided by Firebase, using their key-value store database to track user data and interactions.</p>\n<p>I built this partially to satisfy a desire to return to playing more table-top roleplaying games, but the distance between members of my play group and finding time when we could all play proved to be too much of a hassle. The idea was that this would provide an area where we could play at our own pace.</p>\n<p>The architecture choices I made here were mostly about being able to rapidly iterate and deploy those changes to users. Javascript allows quick changes to be made available to users with a browser refresh and the entire app can be statically served from anywhere. Firebase provides me with database and authentication functions without needing to spend time building an entire backend for a low-value personal project.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/work/dogs-in-the-forum","title":"Dogs in the Forum"}}},"pageContext":{}}
