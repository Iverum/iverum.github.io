  "description": "A tooling system for an in-house game engine at the Digital Corps. Used a web-based front-end to allow designers and writers to input scripts and assets. An API allowed the scripts and assets to be exported into formats the game engine could read. I implemented a set of bash scripts that would poll the API daily and build the new assets into the project, committing the build if it succeeded. Additional scripts would allow developers more control over the importation of assets."
