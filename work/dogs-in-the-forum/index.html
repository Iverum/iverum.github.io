  <h1>Dogs in the Forum</h1>
  <p><a href='https://github.com/Iverum/DogsInTheForum'>Dogs in the Forum</a> is a web app for play-by-post roleplaying using the <a href="http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/DogsInTheVineyard">Dogs in the Vineyard</a> system by <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/">D. Vincent Baker</a>. It is built using Javascript, specifically Node.js and React, to be almost entirely client side. The "backend" is provided by Firebase, using their key-value store database to track user data and interactions.</p>
  <p>I built this partially to satisfy a desire to return to playing more table-top roleplaying games, but the distance between members of my play group and finding time when we could all play proved to be too much of a hassle. The idea was that this would provide an area where we could play at our own pace.</p>
  <p>The architecture choices I made here were mostly about being able to rapidly iterate and deploy those changes to users. Javascript allows quick changes to be made available to users with a browser refresh and the entire app can be statically served from anywhere. Firebase provides me with database and authentication functions without needing to spend time building an entire backend for a low-value personal project.</p>
