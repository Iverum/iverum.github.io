          <p>
            Hello! I am Blake Hair and I'm a polyglot developer with an interest
            in language design. I spend a lot of my time these days using
            Javascript to build software.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been
            <a href="/resume.pdf"
              >building software professionally since 2009</a
            >
            and am interested in the human problems that come up in the industry
            more often than the purely technical ones. I believe that all
            software should start with people and I am looking to learn more
            about managing teams and solving problems with interesting people.
          </p>
          <h1>What I do now?</h1>
          <p>
            Currently I work full time as the lead front-end engineer at
            <a href="https://www.sigstr.com/">Sigstr</a>
            where we are building software that turns email signatures into a
            marketing channel. My focus at the moment is on improving our email
            signature marketing analytics to provide an easy way for marketers
            to show ROI and ownership of their sales pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also do freelance consulting and development at
            <a href="http://www.hairsquaredsoftware.com/"
              >Hair Squared Software</a
            >.
