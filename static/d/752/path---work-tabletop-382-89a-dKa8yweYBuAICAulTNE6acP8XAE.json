{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1><a href=\"https://github.com/Iverum/tabletop\">Tabletop</a></h1>\n<p>This particular project was born out of a need to consolidate my notes while running <a href=\"http://www.dungeon-world.com/\">Dungeon World</a> for friends on a cramped table. This project is a React app that stores data in a browser's local storage for easy note keeping during a game. I used the Bulma CSS framework to get a running start on styling components.</p>\n<p>Currently, the system only supports the playbooks I needed for the game and the basic and special moves that I was referencing. Future work on this would expand to all the basic playbooks and their moves, along with more notekeeping for characters and GMs and the ability to add custom playbooks and moves. A far future vision of this might even include sharable notes between the GM and players through an API.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/\">MobX</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bulma.io/\">Bulma</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/work/tabletop","title":"Tabletop"}}},"pageContext":{}}
