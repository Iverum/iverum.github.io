          Hello! I am Blake Hair and I'm a polyglot developer with an interest
          in language design. I spend a lot of my time these days using
          Javascript to build software.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been building software professionally since 2009 and am
          interested in the human problems that come up in the industry more
          often than the purely technical ones. I believe that all software
          should start with people and I am looking to learn more about managing
          teams and solving problems with interesting people.
        </p>
        <h1>What I Do Now</h1>
        <p>
          Currently I work full time as the lead front-end engineer at Sigstr
          where we are building software that turns email signatures into a
          marketing channel. My focus at the moment is on improving our email
          signature marketing analytics to provide an easy way for marketers to
          show ROI and ownership of their sales pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also do freelance consulting and development at Hair Squared
          Software.
