            My
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-api-server">JSON:API Server</a>
            framework was born from a need for a slightly opinionated server
            to serve an API that subscribed strongly to the JSON:API spec. I
            choose to write my own after trying a number of other frameworks,
            but found none that gave me exactly what I was looking for. They
            were either too opinionated or not opinionated enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began this work for a freelance project required a major rebuild
            of their API in order to more smoothly handle related resources.
            JSON:API provides a very clear way to return related resources for
            a RESTful API.
          </p>
          <p>Work has stalled on this particular project. The client ended up going a different direction. I had
            originally planned to return to this framework, but have not found the time or interest. In the intervening
            years a number of new approaches have popped up making this particular need a little obsolete.</p>
