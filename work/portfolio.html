            <a href="/">My portfolio (being this website)</a> has gone through
            a number of revisions over the years. I have experimented with a
            few content management systems (even rolling my own). I used a
            number of generators such as nanoc & Gatsby. I wrote everything in
            React, but published pages manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            This most recent iteration is entirely hand-coded HTML and CSS. I
            decided on this approach after becoming frustrated with Gatsby and
            the complexity it introduced to something so simple. It caused a
            bit of a paralysis when it came to updating my website. I would
            need to refresh myself on the tools I was using just to publish an
            update!
          </p>
          <p>
            So, with some inspiration from
            <a href="https://www.every-layout.dev">Every Layout</a>, I decided
            to build my own little portfolio by hand. I am not the boldest
            designer, so I stuck with simple colors and layouts using the CSS
            I can write by hand. No compiling or tooling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully, this change will push me to write more and update my
            projects more frequently.
