{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-api-server\">JSON:API Server</a></h1>\n<p>My JSON:API Server framework was born from a need for a slightly opinionated server to serve an API that subscribed strongly to the JSON:API spec. I choose to write my own after trying a number of other frameworks, but found none that gave me exactly what I was looking for. They were either too opinionated or not opinionated enough.</p>\n<p>I began this work for a freelance project required a major rebuild of their API in order to more smoothly handle related resources. JSON:API provides a very clear way to return related resources for a RESTful API.</p>\n<p>At the moment, work has stalled on this framework. The client wanted to go a different direction with my work. I plan to return to this framework in the future to be used in other projects. Currently, the framework can handle serving simple resources with no relations.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jsonapi.org/format/\">JSON:API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://restify.com/\">Restify</a></li>\n<li>Sequelize</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/work/json-api-server","title":"JSON API Server"}}},"pageContext":{}}
