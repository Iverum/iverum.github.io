        <p>
          Hello! I am Blake Hair and I'm a polyglot developer with an interest
          in language design and end-user programming. I spend a lot of my time these days using
          JavaScript to build software.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been
          <a href="/resume.pdf">building software professionally since 2009</a>
          and am interested in the human problems that come up in the industry
          more often than the purely technical ones. I believe that all
          software should start with people and I am looking to learn more
          about managing teams and solving problems with interesting people.
        </p>
        <h1 class="underlined">What I do now?</h1>
        <p>
          Currently I work full time as a senior software engineer at
          <a href="https://terminus.com/">Terminus</a>. My focus is currently with our Chat product where we are
          building tools for sales and marketing to engage customers and prospects with relevant context.
        </p>
        <h1 class="underlined">Where can I be found?</h1>
        <p>You can find me and my programming work on <a href="https://github.com/Iverum">GitHub</a>. Most of my
          professional work is in private repositories, but I have some hobbyist projects available for browsing.</p>
