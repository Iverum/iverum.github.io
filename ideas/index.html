          to document somewhere.</p>

                <p>A tool to manage a home kitchen. Ideally, it would track recent purchases and keep pantry and fridge
                  ingredients up to date.</p>
                <p>Additionally being able to calculate what ingredients in the kitchen are currently allocated toward a
                  weekly menu would be nice.</p>
                <p>Integrating with local grocery APIs would make this ideal, but the major stores have APIs that are
                  locked down to partners.</p>
                <p><a href="https://grocy.info/">Grocy</a> is an open-source kind of this, but appears to be a little
                  broader (home management). Maybe I can provide some UI work to the project, but it's not what I'm
                  looking for.</p>

                <p>Inspired by a cross-country roadtrip to Utah. Social roadtrips where you can share where you're going
                  with other people making roadtrips. Maybe save photos in a way that lets you build automatic
                  slideshows.</p>
                <p>Obvious privacy concerns with tracking location data. Would need clear privacy controls.</p>
                <p>Integration with Google and Facebook for easy location services and sharing seems like a must.</p>
