              is a web app for play-by-post roleplaying using the

                >Dogs in the Vineyard</a

              system by
              <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/">D. Vincent Baker</a>. It is
              built using Javascript, specifically Node.js and React, to be
              almost entirely client side. The "backend" is provided by
              Firebase, using their key-value store database to track user data
              and interactions.

              I built this partially to satisfy a desire to return to playing
              more table-top roleplaying games, but the distance between members
              of my play group and finding time when we could all play proved to
              be too much of a hassle. The idea was that this would provide an
              area where we could play at our own pace.

              The architecture choices I made here were mostly about being able
              to rapidly iterate and deploy those changes to users. Javascript
              allows quick changes to be made available to users with a browser
              refresh and the entire app can be statically served from anywhere.
              Firebase provides me with database and authentication functions
              without needing to spend time building an entire backend for a
              low-value personal project.
